# Mini Relay Board
### Functions
This relay board is designed to be as small as possible using KiCAD to perform functions:
```
  1. Relay Switch Function (250VAC/30VDC rated voltage, 3A-5A rated current)
  2. Power Supply (5V, up to 2A) for microcontroller (e.g. Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, Arduino...)
  3. Push Button Input with Kill Function (i.e. IC kills the power if push button is pressed ~20secs)
  4. General Output pin (3.3V, up to 10mA) for LED/indicators
  5. SMD LED Indicator for Relay
  ```
